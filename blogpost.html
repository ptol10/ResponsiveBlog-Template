    <h3 class="font1">Taylor Swift’s 2023 MTV VMAs</h3>
    <p>
      It’s always nice when Taylor has a fun awards night, but this one was
      basically Taylor’s show from beginning to end. Sorry not sorry to all
      the haters that had to stomach it. The Blonde With The Sparkly Guitar
      did not only win – she swept away with the awards from the shelf. It’s
      been a while since she’s had a run like this.</p><br>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Video of the Year for “Anti-Hero”.</li>
      <li>Artist of the Year.</li>
      <li>Song of the Year for “Anti-Hero”.</li>
      <li>Best Pop for “Anti-Hero”.</li>
      <li>Best Direction for “Anti-Hero”.</li>
      <li>Best Cinematography for “Anti-Hero”.</li>
      <li>Best Visual Effects for “Anti-Hero”.</li>
      <li>Show of the Summer. This one’s new, so I assume this is for the Eras Tour.</li>
      <li>Album of the Year for Midnights.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      She had a fangirl moment when presented the Pop Video Award by a rare reunited NSYNC.<br>
      She also danced the night away and cheered on for the performances and the presenters as well for the other people
      winning awards that night.
