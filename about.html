      Writing is what it’s all about! This site started as a blogging experiment and kinda took on a life of its own.
      <br>
      <br>
      This is a personal celebrity blog. So far, I have seen no need for an economic sponsorship of any kind. I didn’t
      start this as a commercial venture because it’s more of writing hobby of mine. At this moment I’d rather be free
      to write what I like when I can, rather than produce an article on schedule. I tend to like putting my own spin on
      stories, which is why every reporting here is biased. I know my personal brand of humor is a bit dry, which seems
      to fit my writing (I think). Yes, I take sides. I’m with the blond with the sparkly guitar who bakes cookies at
      night and calls it a party.

      I love Taylor Swift and The Agency. I found that news articles about Taylor seem to be either lost about the order
      of events or taking phrases out of context to make up news. You don’t need me to figure it out. But it’s nice to
      just see it on plain text once in a while. I also like writing a lot.
      <br>
      <br>
      I’ve tried to bring the actual blog entry more to the foreground. I will provide you with pictures and media as
      well as long as they pertain to the event (or just a lovely picture of Taylor that I found if there is none) but
      the story comes to the foreground rather than get lost amidst all the graphic art. As a blog, I feel entitled to
      give my own little spin to the story, so I will include inside jokes that only Taylor fans would know. Then again,
      sometimes my humor tends to fall flat as there are inside jokes pertaining to the blog itself.
